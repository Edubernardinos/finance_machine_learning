# **Finance Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Exploration / Visualization**

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains two **machine learning classification tasks** related to finance:

### 1️⃣ Long-Term Company Classification
A classification model that categorizes companies based on their **long-term potential** using fundamental and technical indicators.

### 2️⃣ Stock Time Series Classification
A **time series-based classification model** that analyzes stock price movements to predict future trends.

Both tasks involve **data exploration, visualization, and machine learning model implementation**.
