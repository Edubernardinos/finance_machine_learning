#Finance Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Exploration / Visualization

Overview

This repository contains two machine learning classification tasks related to finance:

Long-Term Company Classification: A classification model that categorizes companies based on their long-term potential using fundamental and technical indicators.

Stock Time Series Classification: A time series-based classification model that analyzes stock price movements to predict future trends.

Both tasks involve data exploration, visualization, and machine learning model implementation.
